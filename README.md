## Top Games – Python Mini Project

Top Games is a console-based Python project that includes multiple mini games like Number Guessing, Rock Paper Scissors, and a Math Calculator.

This project was created as part of my learning journey to improve logical thinking and gain hands-on experience with Python fundamentals such as functions, loops, conditionals, and exception handling.
### Concepts Used
- Python functions
- Loops and conditionals
- Error handling (try-except)
- User input handling
- Basic program structure
